# Maze Generation and Solver Project

## Description

This project is a **maze generator and solver** written in C++. It uses recursive backtracking to generate random mazes and implements breadth-first search (BFS) for pathfinding. The project allows users to generate mazes, add obstacles, and solve them programmatically or manually.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Generates a maze using recursive backtracking.
- **Maze Solving:** Solves the maze using BFS with backtracking for the solution path.
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to add custom obstacles.
- **Visualization:** Displays the maze in the console with clear markings for the start (`S`), end (`E`), walls (`#`), paths (` `), and visited cells (`.`).
- **Customizable Size:** Maze dimensions can be set when initializing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang).
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Eclipse).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sibghatullah-pk/maze-generator-solver.git
   cd maze-generator-solver
   ```
2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   g++ maze.cpp -o maze
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./maze
   ```

## Usage

- The program will generate a maze and display it in the console.
- You can add obstacles by entering coordinates when prompted.
- The maze solver will attempt to find a path from the start (`S`) to the end (`E`).

## Functions Overview

- `generateMaze()`: Generates the maze using recursive backtracking.
- `solveMaze()`: Solves the maze using BFS.
- `addObstacle(int x, int y)`: Allows users to add obstacles at specified coordinates.
- `display()`: Displays the maze in the console.
- `isValid(int x, int y)`: Checks if a cell is within bounds and accessible.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a graphical interface using **SFML** or **Qt**.
- Implement additional pathfinding algorithms (A\*, Dijkstra).
- Support exporting and importing maze layouts.
